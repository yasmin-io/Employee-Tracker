# Employee Tracker

---

Employee Tracking is important when you are trying manage many departments and employees in one go. This command-line application is built to help you better manager and plan your business. It allows you to store information in a database and interact with that to keep it up to date with your newest employees, departments and roles. Using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL, I wanted to challenge myself with some unfamiliar technologies and use this an opportunity to really grasp the idea of databases and how to interact with them correctly using languages like SQL.

## How it Works?

```
Step by step guide through the application:

Start the application by typing 'node index.js' in the Terminal.

You then should be presented with the Options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

When you select 'View All Departments', you should be presented with any and all departments listed in the database  in a formatted table with the corresponding ids.

When you select 'View All Roles', you should be presented with any and all roles listed in the database in a formatted table with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.

When you select 'View All Employees', you should be presented with any and all employees listed in the database in a formatted table with the employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.

When you select 'Add A Department', you will be prompted to enter the name of the department you want to add and it will be added into the database.

When you select 'Add A Role', you will be prompted to enter the name. salary, and department for the role and then that role is then added to the database.

When you select 'Add A Employee', you will be prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager. The new employee will be added to the database.

When you select 'Update an Employee', you should be able to select an employee you want to update from a list of all employees in the database. You are then able to adjust the role of the employee and then this will be saved to the database.

Finally, when you select 'Quit', you will exited out of the application.

## How Do I Correctly Use It?

I have created a walkthrough video that will help you understand the full functionality of the command-line application I have built.
